Maryland, is one of the largest collegiate hackathons on the East Coast, bringing together thousands of students each year. This year kicks off a new era and marks our <b data-v-12def1fe>11th anniversary</b>! Over the past decade, Bitcamp has become a thriving hub of creativity and technical exploration, uniting over <b data-v-12def1fe>10,000</b> passionate hackers who have developed more than <b data-v-12def1fe>1,350</b> innovative projects. As we look back on a decade of breakthroughs, we&#39;re excited to continue pushing boundaries and fostering the next generation of tech leaders. We can&#39;t wait to host over <b data-v-12def1fe>1,000</b> attendees at Bitcamp 2025 <b data-v-12def1fe> in person </b> at the University of Maryland from <b data-v-12def1fe>April 11th to 13th</b>. </p><p data-v-12def1fe> Bitcamp is a melting pot of creativity; a great place to connect with a diverse group of the nation&#39;s brightest innovators. Our hackers are passionate about using their skills to collaboratively solve multi-disciplinary problems. Last year, we introduced an <b data-v-12def1fe>App Development</b> track to introduce hackers to the software development life cycle and a new <b data-v-12def1fe>Cybersecurity</b> track to facilitate discussions of web vulnerabilities. Our popular <b data-v-12def1fe> Machine Learning </b> and <b data-v-12def1fe> Quantum </b> tracks will be returning this year as well. All hackers are also challenged to learn new skills including project management and user-friendly design. </p><p data-v-12def1fe> During Bitcamp 2024, we made some unforgettable memories with over 2,000 hackers who registered to attend the event and saw some incredible talent in the 158 projects that were submitted. Check out the amazing array of hacks at: <b data-v-12def1fe><a href="https://bitcamp2024.devpost.com/project-gallery" data-v-12def1fe>https://bitcamp2024.devpost.com/project-gallery</a></b>! </p><p data-v-12def1fe> Bitcamp offers a prime opportunity for recruitment and tech mentorship.
